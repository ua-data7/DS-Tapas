## Metagenomics with phyloseq in R


April 6, 2023

### Description:

Metagenomics is the study of the entire nucleotide sequences isolated and analyzed from all organisms (typically microbes) in a bulk sample. The analysis of microbial communities brings many challenges: the integration of many different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, network analysis, visualization and testing. 

In this session of Data Science Tapas, we will explore how to use the {phyloseq} package to facilitate the use of `R` for efficient interactive and reproducible analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.

Check out the [slides](https://hidyverse.github.io/phyloseq/).

### Take Away:

`phyloseq.R` can be run again to reinforce the concepts discussed in this session.
