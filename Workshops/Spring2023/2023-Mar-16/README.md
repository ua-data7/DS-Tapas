## Genomep-wide association studies with hail scalable software


March 16, 2023

### Description:

Data science and machine learning both benefit from large amounts of data, however, large amounts of genomic data become quicly un-managable for many research groups. Hail allows researchers a completely hands-off approach to scaling, keeping analsis the same regardless of the number of genomes to be analyzed. 

In this session of Data Science Tapas, we will explore how to use hail genomic software for a common genetic analysis. 

Check out the [slides](https://hidyverse.github.io/gwasHail).

### Take Away:

`gwas.py` is an example gwas run with the hail software. 

### Possible Workflow:

1.  Create a free account with [CyVerse](https://user.cyverse.org) (Hint: Use your arizona.edu address)
2. Launch the Data Science Jupyter Lab Featured VICE app
3. Follow `gwas.py` line by line
